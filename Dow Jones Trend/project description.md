## Background
One of the biggest financial crises worldwide happened at 2008. Although many economist and analyst alert the decision makers about the potential problems, people were optimistic about the economy and housing prize reached historical high in America. As we all know now, with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, stock market crashed for the next several years since Sep 2008. The aftermath influenced a decade of people.

## Goal
In this project, I used RNN model,LSTM model and GRU model to predict the stock price and trend during Sep 2008 when financial crisis happened. And compare the performance of these models.
